<p>I'm thrilled the time is finally here to apply for Blizzard internships.</p>

<p>Becoming a Blizztern would be an absolute game changer for my early career potential.</p>

<p>Not to mention, it's the literal company I have wanted to work for since middle school. Having the honor to participate in either Game Design or Game Engineering internships would be the epitomic "This doesn't happen to people like me" moment to top all others for me and my particular goals and dreams.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed, toes crossed, hair braided, eyes crossed.</p>

<p>Please pump every ounce of positive vibes in my direction if you would so kindly. I need everything you could possibly spare!</p>
