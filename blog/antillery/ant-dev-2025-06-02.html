                    <p>
                        Antillery invites players who enjoy strategy layered with unpredictability. It draws from the
                        artillery genre's long history but repurposes familiar systems to explore less familiar
                        outcomes. While some tools appear restorative or nonviolent, their true power depends on how the
                        player uses them. Destruction might come from a missile or a well-placed sunflower. This blend
                        of intent and consequence makes the game accessible to newcomers while rewarding mastery,
                        mischief, and improvisation. </p>
                </section>

                <hr class="section-divider">

                <section id="longtime-fans" class="devlog-section version-section hover-transform-up">
                    <h2 class="funnel-display-header">Longtime Artillery Fans</h2>
                    <p>
                        Players who grew up with Scorched Earth or Worms shaped the artillery genre through precision,
                        chaos, and clever terrain use. They learned to expect indirect combat, physics-driven tools, and
                        movement that doubled as personality. That history still defines how the genre feels today.</p>

                    <p>Antillery keeps those features in place: deformable maps, angled shots, limited mobility, and
                        momentum-based action. However, it adds something unexpected. Some tools restore terrain or
                        create cover, yet they can also trap enemies or limit their next move. Even a flower can cut off
                        a retreat.</p>

                    <p>Antillery shifts meaning without changing the form. The shape of the game stays familiar, but
                        its strategic depth expands.

                    <h2 class="funnel-display-header">Newcomers to the Genre</h2>
                    <p>
                        Not every player has experience playing artillery games. The skill-based barrier of entry might
                        be challenging for some, with timed shots, weird angles, and no second chances. Antillery lowers
                        the barrier without sacrificing depth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It teaches through play. Turns move fast, aiming feels intuitive, and outcomes are visible.
                        Peace tools soften early mistakes by keeping ants alive longer. These tools act like training
                        wheels but still carry risk. A misplaced flower can block an escape or flip the match.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By offering tools that teach without preaching, Antillery brings new players in without
                        flattening the experience. The genre stays sharp, but now more players can reach its depth.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="funnel-display-header">Casual Gamers</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some players want quick games, unpredictable outcomes, and moments worth laughing about.
                        Antillery welcomes that energy without making the experience disposable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rounds move fast, but every choice still carries weight. Peace tools shift the flow in ways that
                        explosions might not, stalling a turn, blocking a shot, or setting up accidental outcomes.
                        Players who experiment can win by planning or turning chaos into a strategy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Antillery gives casual players room to play without pressure. The game stays fun whether someone
                        is aiming for mastery or just trying to mess with their friends.

                    <h2 class="funnel-display-header">Competitive Players</h2>
                    <p>
                        Players who seek mastery look beyond explosions. Antillery offers layered complexity where every
                        decision, including restraint, carries weight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Winning depends on more than aim. Terrain can be shaped or repaired. Players can outsmart their
                        opponent into wasting a turn. Some tools pressure through presence alone, setting traps, or
                        forcing a mistake without firing a shot. Competitive players learn to control space, deny
                        momentum, and plan turns ahead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Antillery rewards those who think past raw damage. The strongest matches often hinge on who
                        considered both sides of combat, not who fired first.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="funnel-display-header">Strategy Without a Fixed Form</h2>
                    <p>
                        Antillery is not one game played one way. It adjusts to the player, whether they chase chaos,
                        control, mischief, or mastery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rules stay simple. Shots behave consistently, and movement follows a predictable arc, but
                        outcomes shift based on what each player hopes to build, block, or break. Even peace tools bend
                        under pressure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The result is a strategy game without deterministic outcomes. Destruction and restoration share
                        inputs. Meaning comes from how players use them.
                    </p>
