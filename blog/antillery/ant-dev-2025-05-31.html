                            This proposal outlines the concept, inspiration, and
                            creative goals behind <em>Antillery</em>, a
                            senior capstone project that aims to turn the
                            artillery game genre on its warhead.

                        <h3 class="content-heading">What is Antillery?</h3>

                        <p><em>Antillery</em> is a satirical take on the beloved
                            artillery game format. Inspired by the
                            iconic "Worms" franchise created by Team17,
                            <em>Antillery</em> maintains the same strategic,
                            turn-based, destructively chaotic gameplay typical
                            of an artillery-type game while
                            introducing peace-oriented mechanics that border on
                            disruptive and destructive in their own
                            right.</p>

                        <p>In addition to the traditional arsenal of artillery,
                            <em>Antillery</em> arms players with a new
                            category of "eco-friendly" and "nonviolent" weaponry
                            and tools, eco-friendly, restorative, or
                            passive-aggressive, but still disruptive and
                            impactful in battle.</p>

                        <h3 class="content-heading">Genre Classification</h3>

                        <p>Antillery fits the classification of a 2D turn-based
                            strategy game, belonging specifically to the
                            artillery subgenre. It draws from the tradition of
                            artillery games while building on the
                            genre's core loop of indirect, physics-based combat
                            within a turn-based system.</p>

                        <p>Artillery games typically involve players alternating
                            turns to reposition units, aim and fire
                            projectiles, and adapt to environmental variables
                            such as wind or destructible terrain. These
                            features create emergent gameplay scenarios that are
                            easy for most players to pick up but have
                            a level of strategic depth that offers extensive
                            replayability.</p>

                            Simulation: Origin Story</h3>

                        <p>The earliest artillery games emerged as text-based
                            simulations on mainframe computers in the
                            1960s. While primitive compared to today's games,
                            these early experiments in electronic
                            entertainment established many of the core mechanics
                            defining the genre for decades.</p>

                        <p>The earliest simulations were developed using BASIC
                            and were entirely text-based, requiring
                            players to imagine the evolving battlefield. Players
                            took turns entering parameters such as
                            barrel angle and firing velocity.</p>

                        <p>These early simulations had a limited player base of
                            mainframe operators who implemented and
                            circulated their new features. Although direct
                            visual records of mainframe-era artillery games
                            are scarce, their design legacy persisted. By the
                            early 1980s, successors like Artillery Duel
                            (1983) began introducing simple vector graphics and
                            visual interfaces on home consoles.</p>

                            Evolution of Customization</h3>

                        <p class="section-intro">Scorched Earth was released in
                            1991 and marked a pivotal moment, breathing
                            new life into the artillery genre. Unlike its
                            text-based predecessors, it was in full color,
                            real-time, and standardized many of the hallmark
                            conventions of artillery games.</p>

                        <p>Scorched Earth expanded significantly on the
                            foundational mechanics of earlier artillery games by
                            implementing over thirty weapons, ranging from
                            conventional missiles to napalm. Much of its
                            acclaim came from its level of strategic depth,
                            afforded by its fully destructible terrain,
                            customizable parameters such as wind and gravity,
                            and a robust in-game economy.</p>

                        <p>This landmark artillery title introduced several
                            design ideas that became hallmarks of the genre

                            New Backbone</h3>

                        <p class="section-intro">Worms, released by Team17 in
                            1995, marked a turning point in the artillery
                            game genre. While its gameplay preserved core
                            projectile mechanics, its presentation shifted the
                            genre from simulation to satirical multiplayer
                            chaos.</p>

                        <p>Creator Andy Davidson entered the game, called
                            initially Total Wormage, into a competition by
                            Amiga Format magazine. Though it did not win, it
                            caught Team17's attention, which went on to
                            publish it across multiple platforms (Nuttall 26;
                            Barton).</p>

                        <p>Worms emphasized player mobility, absurdity, and
                            personality, unlike its tank-centric
                            predecessors. Worms could walk, jump, and swing
                            across terrain using ninja ropes and parachutes,
                            adding momentum and physical comedy to a genre
                            previously rooted in physics realism.</p>

                        <p>Barton observed,
                            "The worms can do much more than tanks," describing
                            moments of dramatic
                            acrobatics. Its tone embraced British comedic
                            absurdity, transforming once-serious combat into a
                            stage for slapstick and satire.</p>

                        <p>Exploding sheep, banana bombs, and absurd weapons
                            blurred the line between threat and punchline.
                            Cheeky voice lines like "First blood!" and
                            "This worm is an ex-worm!" gave the game personality
                            and flair, establishing a new kind of identity for
                            artillery games, one dripping in irony,
                            theatricality, and joyful nonsense.</p>

                            Context</h2>

                        <p class="section-intro"><em>Antillery's</em> goal is to
                            push the boundaries of artillery combat,
                            drawing inspiration from Worms while evolving the
                            genre in bold new directions.</p>

                            Innovation</h3>

                        <p>Worms redefined artillery combat through absurdist
                            humor and player mobility, transforming a
                            simulation-focused genre into something entirely
                            new. <em>Antillery</em> takes its lead by
                            blending modern cultural satire with new
                            peace-driven gameplay mechanics, honoring the spirit
                            of
                            innovation introduced by Worms while pushing the
                            artillery genre into a new frontier.</p>

                        <p>The goal of <em>Antillery</em> is not to apply new
                            paint to a formulaic experience but to evolve
                            the artillery genre in the way that Worms did in its
                            day. Just as Worms brought personality and
                            absurdity to what was once a sterile simulation,
                            <em>Antillery</em> introduces a satirical
                            examination of conflict resolution through
                            gameplay.</p>

                        <h3 class="content-heading">The Balance of War and
                            Peace</h3>

                        <p>Players still have access to traditional artillery
                            weapons like bazookas and grenades. However,
                            in <em>Antillery</em>, they may also employ new
                            strategies centered on peace, love, and
                            environmental restoration. This duality challenges
                            players to rethink what combat can be,
                            forcing them to balance war and peace as part of
                            their tactical thinking.</p>

                        <p>Nevertheless, even actions of peace, love, and
                            environmentalism sometimes create destructive
                            outcomes. A sunflower might create a shielding
                            canopy, an isolating barrier, or a bridge to
                            strategic ground. In <em>Antillery</em>, every
                            action, whether peaceful or aggressive, becomes
                            part of a larger strategy shaped by the player.</p>
