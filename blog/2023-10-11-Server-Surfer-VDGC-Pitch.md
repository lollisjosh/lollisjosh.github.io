<h1>Server Surfer (Neon Cloud) Pitch</h1>
<br>
<p>I found this slide presentation while going through my cloud storage. The presentation covers the design of a game I was intending at the Video Game Development Club pitch meeting at CSUF.</p>

<p>You may recognize this project from my <a href="https://telloviz.netlify.app/cv/">resume</a>, <a href="https://telloviz.netlify.app/about/">about-me</a>, and <a href="https://telloviz.netlify.app/projects/neoncloud">project pages</a>. This is a project I worked on under my mentorship. I wanted to further flesh it out while gaining valuable teamwork and leadership experience. This is what led me to turn it into a pitch in the first place.</p>


<p>The pitch meeting occurs at the start of each semester. At this meeting, anyone developing a game and looking for help can present their game idea, whether it's a large-scale project or a smaller one, to the members of the club.</p>

<p>This was my first experience with this sort of scenario, and to play it safe, I decided instead to join an existing team. Not pitching my idea spared me the pitfalls and stress of jumping into a huge undertaking like leading a project in a setting unfamiliar as a first-timer. In hindsight, I believe it was a wise choice as it granted me the freedom to learn from the inside what to expect in this setting and focus on maximizing my initial experience.</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas for this project and hope to get back to it in full some day soon! (Perhaps once this internship season dies down üòÖ)</p>

<p>Thanks for checking it out!</p>
