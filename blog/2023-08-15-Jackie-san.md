    <p>Since purchasing our condo in Fullerton in 2020, I befriended our 96-year-old HOA neighbor, Jackie.</p>
    <p>Her only local relation was her stepson, who lived up in Northern California, and would come down to see her from time to time, trying to convince her to sell her place.</p>
    <p>Jackie would often be out taking little walks; she lived alone. At that age... she is a testament to fortitude and willpower.</p>
    <p>Many of us can only attempt to fathom living alone at 96, with no biological family on this side of the planet.</p>
    <p>The lady had to have been made of diamond.</p>
    <p>Even diamonds aren't indestructible, and she was not shy to express her physical and emotional pains.</p>
    <p>She not only openly expressed her satisfaction with life but also her willingness to embrace what comes after.</p>
    <p>I would just listen and express my empathy, and that I understood (the best I could at least).</p>
    <p>At her age, she deserved the respect of having whatever she wanted. As one of the eldest humans, she, and she alone, would know what she deserved and needed.</p>
    <p>She told me so many stories in our time as friends. She originally came from Osaka. Her siblings remained in Japan but had each visited her here in California. Her dad never got a chance before he passed.</p>
    <p>I know that she once brought home a cat that her boss found in their workplace. She told me about her love for that cat and for animals.</p>
    <p>She was a widow, but that didn't halt her love life. She told me about a professor of music (we live a 10-minute walk from CSUF) that lived in my particular condo before me, many years ago.</p>
    <p>She glowed when she told me about their chemistry, how they became close, and how they would have long conversations. She took him to a Japanese restaurant for dinner; she had fallen in love, and obviously still was all those years later.</p>
    <p>She told me about how he got a girlfriend, then quickly moved away. I could see the feelings that she still carried through her eyes.</p>
    <p>Jackie was 1/2 my height, and she had an energy. Her face beamed instantly every time she saw me. However, I began to see a change in her eyes, a shift to the energy that was undeniable.</p>
    <p>I had nearly mustered the courage to try out my recent progress in my 10 years of Japanese study in hopes to surprise her. I didn't take the chance, and the chance was taken from me.</p>
    <p>The last thing she said to me was that I looked fancy, that I looked really good, 3 times in a row 😅. And the last thing I overheard her say was that I was really nice and she liked me. 🤠</p>
    <p>I am sad for today, but I'm not sad for Jackie. I'm happy that I got to know her. I will carry your energy, my friend! Her insight and wisdom are her life force that will persist through me.</p>
    <p>ジャッキぃ先輩ご冥福をお祈りいたします🙏</p>
    <p>💜ありがとうございます ジャッキィさん💜</p>
