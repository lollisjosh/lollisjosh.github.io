## :: Lerp ::
### The planes will be painted red... ...with a smooth transition to purple, then blue.

Today, I learned how to utilize *Linear Interpolation* (Lerp) in Unity.

Lerping is...

*No, not that...*

*Linear Interpolation*is a linear transition between two coordinate points on any bi-axial plane. A *color picker* is essentially a graph of hues, where each color has an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. Choosing two colors is thus equivalent to choosing two coordinate points on a graph of color data. Lerping then, in the scope of color, means to smoothly transition from one color coordinate to the other. This is by no means the only use case for lerping either. Anything that can be represented as two points on a plane can be linearly interpolated.

## :: Lerp in Game Dev ::

Linear Interpolation has many use cases in video game development. A character can be lerped from one position to another by way of transformation, an object can be interpolated on a rotational axis from one angle to another, or as in my game, colors can be interpolated. As I've said, linear interpolation can really be used for any situation that can be represented as a pair of coordinates.

Here's how lerp is utilized in my game, Neon Cloud:

![BG Lerp][lerbg_gif]


What you're seeing is a series of 10 sprite panels that make up the background. Each panel is lerping over a series of colors, offset from one-another by a fraction of time. The overall effect I've created is a retro-like box gradient of gradients. 

**VS.**

This is the old background, which chooses from a random color range at startup, and that's it...BORING

### This must be some sort of Lerp Wizardry...

**No!** Not that!

## If you'd like to see how I've accomplished this effect, please check back for upcoming blog posts. I will show some code snippets and explain a little further what's going on here.
