                <p>This is the first official dev log post for Project GAL.</p>
                <br>
                <section class="devlog-section">
                    <h2>Background/Intentions</h2>
                    <p>Project GAL aims to fill the gap in my portfolio with a 3D game development project, enhancing my prospects in the
                        video game industry job market. I aim to have this project in a playable state by the end of this month (September
                        2023) so I can include it on internship applications. This is going to be developed in parallel with my semester
                        workload so that will certainly hold priority over this.</p>

                    <h2>Development/Approach</h2>
                    <p>Originally, the project was a Western-themed 3D bullet-hell game. To ensure timely completion, I simplified it into a
                        3D rail-based Western gallery shooter inspired by Disneyland's <i>Toy Story Midway Mania</i> and the arcade classic
                        <i>Time Crisis</i>
                    </p>
                    <ul class="devlog-list">
                        <li>Design patterns for controlling game-flow logic:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Currently using Tarodev's singleton systems.</li>
                                <li>Possibly return to a C# native State Machine and custom event system for better code decoupling.</li>
                                <li>I also like the additive scenes approach, allowing for a base scene with other additive scenes to mask it.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Minimize the use of <i>magic numbers</i> in code by exposing primitives to the editor with Unity's
                            <i>SerializedFields</i>
                        </li>
                        <li>Utilize dependency injection by utilizing <i>SerializedFields</i> and <i>Scriptable Objects</i> where applicable.
                        </li>
                        <li>Prefab any scene GameObjects to improve git merges and give tracked data meaningful human readable representation.
                        </li>
                        <li>Prefab for reuse, allowing for the original concept to be quickly made later by simply modifying this project</li>
                    </ul>

                        <p>The initial dolly-track navigation presented camera challenges due to sudden directional changes.</p>

                        <p>I redesigned the path as a straight-track with player-controlled first-person aiming. Players can look around
                            within set limits, improving immersion. A centered reticle follows mouse-controlled camera motion.</p>

                        <p>The player character was initially planned for 3rd-person POV but the complexity of 3D character rigging/animating
                            is time-consuming and not vital at this time.</p>

                        <p>Opted for a 1st person POV to eliminate the need for any player character visuals outside the player's arm/gun.</p>

                    <h2>Project Impact</h2>
                    <p>The time spent on this project has already contributed to my growth as a game developer. While I haven't delved
                        deeply into 3D game projects, this one has highlighted areas for improvement.</p>

                    <p>For instance, I've gained practical experience with object rotations and Quaternions, translating my knowledge from
                        the Computer Graphics college course I took. I can then use what I've experienced in my practical use of these
                        concepts in creating more dynamic in-game movement and animations.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, this project has clarified the complexities of Unity's Editor/Play Mode dynamic, thanks to techniques
                        like Tarodev's singleton systems. I will use this knowledge to build games with a more straightforward and user
                        friendly architecture, allowing for code reuse in future projects. This will allow me to speed up prototyping new
                        ideas.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, I've learned to accept help from tutorials while balancing my desire for independent problem-solving.
                        This approach has deepened my understanding and appreciation of Unity's capabilities and will fast track my own
                        ability for future projects.</p>
