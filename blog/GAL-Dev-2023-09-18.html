    <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>


    <p>This <em>Project Gal Dev Log</em> provides a brief overview of the first-person aim-control I implemented in
        a
        recent development sprint. I will go over my initial goal for this sprint, the challenges that I ran into,
        and a
        brief discussion of my thought processes leading to accomplishing this sprint goal.</p>



    <h2><strong>Initial Goal</strong></h2>


    <p>Since Gal is inspired by the classic carnival gallery shooting games, the initial goal was to allow the
        player an
        <em>angle-restricted</em> first-person camera control, using the mouse/gamepad. A sub-challenge emerged
        after
        accomplishing this goal, where the player-model's weapon-hand did not follow the player's view as it should
        in a
        first-person shooter-type game. A bulk of this sprint was spent solving this aspect.

            behind
            various stage props. In
            Gal, the player traverses the level on a dolly-track. The dolly track aspect is inspired by my love of
            the
            Disneyland attraction: Toy Story Midway Mania</em>.</blockquote>



    <h2><strong>First-Person Aim Controls</strong></h2>


    <h4>Challenge:</h4>
    <p>Since Gal is a sort-of fps game, the primary task was to implement fps-style aiming controls.</p>
    <p>I came to an initial working-solution for the fps control implementation; however, I never felt satisfied
        with
        the overly complicated nature of the technique I was adapting. This solution required the use of a
        custom
        <em>Cinemachine Virtual Camera Extension</em>. The extension script constantly threw warning messages in
        my
        console.
    </p>
    <p>In an attempt to simplify things, I imported the official <em>Unity Starter Package First-Person
            Controller</em>.
        After
        importing the package, my editor started to crash occasionally.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4>Approach/Solution</h4>


    <p>To eventually overcome the instability caused by the First-Person Controller package, I created a new
        empty
        Unity
        project. I imported the asset package to this project and deleted anything I didn't need. I then
        exported it
        as a new package with a trimmed set of assets. The editor crash issue has since ceased.</p>

    <p>From then on, player-controlled Camera rotation was made possible using the <em>Unity Input System
            Package</em>.
        A <strong><em>Player Input Component</em></strong> on my <strong><em>Input Manager</em></strong> game
        object
        is
        in charge of triggering a <em><strong>Unity Event</strong></em> for each of the registered input action
        the
        user
        performs.</p>

    <p>In my case, the
        <em>OnLook</em> input event trigger was set to call the
        <strong><em>FirstPersonController.onLook(CallbackContext)</em></strong> function every time the player
        moves
        the
        mouse / joystick.
    </p>
    <hr>

    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="../assets/img/posts/gal-dev/OnLook.png" alt="OnLook.png">

    <hr>


    <p>The player camera's updated <em>pitch</em> and <em>yaw</em> are calculated and applied to the
        camera's
        transform
        each time the <strong><em>OnLook(CallbackContext)</em></strong> function is called. Inside this
        <strong><em>OnLook(CallbackContext)</em></strong> function is a simple call to a pre-existing
        function
        from the
        <em>Starter Asset First-Person Controller Script</em> I'm modifying:
    </p>

    <pre class="cscode"><code><span class="com">// Public function for the Unity Event to call when a "Look" occurs</span>
        <span class="key">public</span> <span class="key">void</span> OnLook(CallbackConteblockxt context) {
        
            CameraRotation(context.ReadValue&lt;Vector2&gt;());
        }</code></pre>

    <h3><strong>Player View Range Too Wide/Tall</strong></h3>


    <h4>Challenge</h4>
    <p>Initially, players had the ability to view in all directions with no angular-limit, which turned
        out
        to
        be
        the
        source of a few distinct issues:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can see parts of player's model that should not be seen (<strong>bad for immersion</strong>)
        </li>
        <li>Can <em>shoot</em> back of horse head (<strong>undesirable behavior</strong>)</li>
        <li>Arm passes through player-model body (<strong>unrealistic / bad for immersion</strong>)</li>
        <li>Gives more time to hit targets already passed-by (<strong>reduces prioritization
                challenge</strong>)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h4>Approach/Solution</h4>
    <p>As can be seen in the following snippet, camera rotation is being clamped in 4 distinct
        directions.
        The
        original
        file
        I am modifying only clamped the two-axes symmetrically (one clamp for horizontal, one clamp
        for
        vertical).
    </p>
    <p>I introduced the 4-direction clamp to remedy a couple of issues:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Upward clamp</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Keeps the player from looking too far into the sky (there's no targets up there
                    currently)
                </li>
                <li>Promotes target prioritization.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Downward clamp</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Restricts view of untidy off-camera aspects</li>
                <li>Removes temptation to <em>shoot your horse</em></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Horizontal clamp</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Remains symmetrical</li>
                <li>Distinct left/right clamps provided for future potential and to maintain
                    consistency
                    with
                    up/down
                    clamp pattern.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <p>I was able to determine the optimal clamp values by exposing a float value for each clamp to the
        editor.
        This
        allowed me to adjust during play-mode testing.</p>

    <h3><strong>Model Artifacts Permeating View</strong></h3>

    <h4>Challenge:</h4>


    <p>Additionally, with this solution in place, I began to see player-model artifacts permeating the
        camera
        frustum.
        These were small cross-sections of the player-model's face. The solution itself didn't cause
        these
        artifacts,
        but since the camera was not in the player's control, new issues such as this began to surface.
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h4>Approach/Solution</h4>
    <p>I solved the issue with model artifacts bleeding into view quickly by simply translating the neck
        bone
        from
        the
        player character armature toward the inside of the player character's model.</p>

    <h2><strong>Player-Model Arm Orientation Issues</strong></h2>

    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>Haphazard importation of 3rd-party models and assets throughout the early development stages left
        some
        prefab's
        transforms in awkward states of disorientation. This made it especially difficult to get a
        consistent
        set of
        vectors to use when trying to manipulate the player-model's arm toward the camera/aim.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>Approach/Solution</h3>


    <h5><strong>Armature Reorientation:</strong></h5>
    <p>To address the orientation issues, I aligned the left-arm into a T-pose, ensuring that all arm bones
        pointed
        uniformly forward. I then carefully aligned the revolver pistol into the arm's hand, aligning it
        with
        the
        arm's
        forward vector direction.</p>

    <hr>

    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="../assets/img/posts/gal-dev/armature.PNG" alt="armature.PNG">

    <blockquote><em><strong>Above:</strong> The model's left-hand armature in alignment.</em></blockquote>
    <hr>

    <p>This was a key step in attaining the expected arm behavior. I could then easily place an
        <em>Animation
            Rigging</em> package <em>Multi-Aim Constraint</em> component in the armature hierarchy to
        automatically
        do the work of rotating the shoulder of the arm/hand holding the gun, effectively aiming the
        revolver!

    <h5><strong>Aim Point Determination:</strong></h5>
    <p>A raycast was employed to determine the player's aim point. The ray was cast from the player toward
        the
        world
        mouse position. The world mouse position was easily attained via the CallbackContext object passed
        to
        the
        OnLook
        function when the input asset system invoked the OnLook function.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <hr>
    <h5>Invisible Walls</h5>
    <p>Additionally, an invisible bounding box was placed around the level to give the casted ray a place to
        hit
        no
        matter where the player aims. This was to ensure that there was always a new point to update the
        debug
        sphere in
        the previously seen gif, as well as the arm's aim vector. Otherwise, when aiming in the sky, the
        sphere/arm
        would stop moving until the ray cast logic identified another collision.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2><strong>Player Feedback</strong></h2>

    <p>Initial player feedback indicates the need for a smoother camera control. Players indicated that the
        camera
        can
        move too quickly, making it harder to control and thus potentially less enjoyable.</p>

    <h2><strong>To Be Addressed</strong></h2>
    <p>As of this log, a few issues remain and need attention:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Arm clipping issues
            <ul>
                <li>I believe this happens when the arm is ~parallel with the view-frustum</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Camera movement jitter
            <ul>
                <li>As mentioned in the feedback section, the aim movement needs to be interpolated/smoothed
                    a
                    bit
                    to
                    provide an easier to control aim mechanic.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2><strong>Next Time:</strong></h2>
    <p>In the next <em>Project Gal Dev Log</em>, I plan to discuss the shoot input control and its callback
        listener
        <strong><em>OnShoot(CallbackContext)</em></strong>. You can see a preview of my progress in the
        following
        gif!
    </p>

    <blockquote><em><strong>Above:</strong> Wait... your guns can shoot?</em></blockquote>

    <hr>

    <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the development of the aiming mechanic in Project GAL involved overcoming challenges related
        to
        package importation, world/local vector orientation issues, camera clipping artifacts, inverse kinematic
        rigging
        and its <em>MultiAimConstraint</em> component.</p>

    <p>Re-orienting the character model's armature to a consistent forward vector orientation, debugging with
        raycastHit
        for world mouse position, and the <em>MultiAimConstraint</em> component technique, are what eventually led
        me
        to successfully implementing the view mechanic, and subsequent in solving the challenge of syncing the
        player-model's arm with that view mechanic!</p>
    <p>I could go on for some time more about this sprint, but I'm eager to keep developing!</p>
