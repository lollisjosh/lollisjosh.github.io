<h4>Background:</h4>
<p>I had made a prototype version (The green-toned was created by me for the prototype version). During the 2-week jam, we took this prototype project I'd made, and re-made it with the intention on adding the 2nd layer mechanic(The 4-way grid fishing scene).</p>

        This project was a fun leap out of our comfort zone.

<h4>Shortcomings:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The meter doesn't replenish when winning.</li>
    <li>No way to reset game session</li>
    <li>No win state (or lose state)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Overall I think we did well for one of our first projects together, and one of hefty challenge to us at the time. It was a lot of fun working with my brother on this!</blockquote>
