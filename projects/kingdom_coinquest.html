                <p><em>The Deck of the Four Kingdoms is rife with conflict. You must crown your king,
                    hone your steel, and command your people. Do you have the strategic mind to defeat your rival kings? Or, will your
                    name fade with time? It's time to breathe life into that dusty old deck of cards!</em></p>

                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p>The goal of Kingdom Coinquest is to defeat your rival kingdoms. Players will draw
                until they have 3 cards in hand each turn. Choose strategically the source from where you draw your cards. You have
                3 options, The Forge (deck), The Graveyard (community discard) or your Salvage Yard (your set of 3 personal discard
                slots).</p>
                
                <h3>Victory</h3>
                <p>Victory is accomplished by playing Equipment Cards on your Quartermaster to be prepared for use by your Knight and Peasant. Once prepared, an Equipment card can then be equipped to either your Knight or your Peasant, during your Play Phase. Use your Peasants to attack a rival kingdom. Use your Knight to defend your King. Once a King has depleted his 20 health points, he is no longer in play. Be the last King standing and you are victorious!</p>

                    <h3>Forge</h3>
                    <p>The Forge is your primary source for stocking your hand each turn. The Forge deck is 1 of the 3 places you can draw from during the Draw Phase of your turn.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Graveyard</h3>
                    <p>The Graveyard is a community shared discard pile. The Graveyard serves a dual purpose. It is also 1 of 3 places you can choose to draw from during the Draw Phase of your turn. The Graveyard is always stacked face up, and only the top card is accessible at any time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Be careful! Anything you discard to the Graveyard is then retrievable during the Draw Phase of a rival kingdom's turn!</strong></p>
                    
                    <h3>Salvage Yard</h3>
                    <p>There are 3 spots in your area of the play field labeled "Salvage". These are additional discard slots which can hold 1 card each. These cards can be retrieved just like drawing from the Forge or the Graveyard. However, your Salvage Cards are only accessible to you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Only 1 card per Salvage spot. 3 total salvage cards per player at any time.</em></p>
                    
                    <h3>Quartermaster Slot</h3>
                    <p>The preparer and provider of weapons and armor for your Knight and Peasant. One card may be played here at a time. An Equipment card played here enters preparation. The only time an Equipment card will not need to be prepared by your Quartermaster is when you play an Ace Card. An Ace can Resurrect the top card of the Graveyard directly onto the Knight or Peasant. Depending on the value of the Equipment Card, the preparation cost varies. The cost of preparation is paid in turns.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The only way to remove an Equipment Card in process is to either wait until it's done being prepared or discard it directly to the Graveyard on your Discard Phase.</em></p>
                    
                    <h4>Preparation Costs (based on numeric card value)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2-4 = 1 turn preparation</li>
                        <li>5-7 = 2 turns preparation</li>
                        <li>8-10 = 3 turns preparation</li>

                    <p>The leader of your Kingdom. He must be protected at all costs. The King starts with 20 health points. A king is defeated when he has 0 or less health. The final King standing is the victor.</p>
                    <p><strong>Non-Player Kings:</strong> These kings are not used in the game; they are set aside outside of the play area.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Queen</h3>
                    <div class="flex-center">
                        <img width="80" src="/assets/images/kingdom-coinquest/HeartQueen.png" alt="Heart Queen" class="hover-transform-up">
                    </div>
                    <p>The King's right hand. She has vowed to protect her people and their way of life. The Queen will fully absorb 1 incoming attack, in <strong>all</strong> cases where a Knight is not available to defend the King. The Queen stays in play until defeated. A defeated Queen is then discarded to the <strong>bottom</strong> of the Graveyard.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Only 1 Queen can be active per player at a time.</em></p>
                    
                    <h3>Jack</h3>
                    <div class="flex-center">
                        <img width="80" src="/assets/images/kingdom-coinquest/Jacks.png" alt="Jacks" class="hover-transform-up">
                    </div>
                    <p>The <em>Jack of all trades</em> has no particular allegiance. Jacks are a wild card that can be used to recruit any equipment card to your allegiance. A card that was Recruited by using a Jack still needs to be prepared by the Quartermaster.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Only 1 Jack can be in play per player at any time.</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>A Jack can only be used on Equipment Cards. (He may not be used to Recruit a Queen or an Ace. These cards may be Recruited, but not with a Jack.)</em></p>

                <div class="skill-category hover-transform-up">
                    <h3>Equipment Cards (numbered suits)</h3>
                    <p>These cards represent weapons and armor. The Quartermaster prepares these resources for use by your Peasant or Knight. The value of the card influences its effect and preparation cost. Equip an Equipment Card to your Peasant to allow him to attack on a future play move. The Peasant can attack for the value indicated on the Equipment Card. Likewise, equip your Equipment Card to a Knight, to add that card's value in defense to your Knight. Use the Knight to defend your King.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>To unequip an Equipment Card, simply replace it with a different prepared Equipment Card. The equipment being replaced is then placed on the top of the Graveyard. This <strong>does not</strong> count as your Discard Phase.</em></p>
                    
                    <h3>Recruited Cards</h3>
                    <p>A pair of cards not of your kingdom's suit of arms. They count as individual cards until played together. Playing the 2 cards together is known as <strong>recruiting.</strong> A recruited card can be played as a card of your suit. Any card may become a recruited card when paired with another card of its same type regardless of suit. However, a Jack (wild card) may only be used for Recruiting Equipment (number-valued cards). A Jack cannot be used in Recruiting a Queen or Ace.</p>
