                    <p><em>The Deck of the Four Kingdoms is rife with conflict.
                            You must crown your king,
                            hone your steel, and command your people. Do you
                            have the strategic mind to defeat your rival kings?
                            Or, will your
                            name fade with time? It's time to breathe life into
                            that dusty old deck of cards!</em></p>

                    <h3>The Goal</h3>
                    <p>The goal of Kingdom Coinquest is to defeat your rival
                        kingdoms. Players will draw
                        until they have 3 cards in hand each turn. Choose
                        strategically the source from where you draw your cards.
                        You have
                        3 options, The Forge (deck), The Graveyard (community
                        discard) or your Salvage Yard (your set of 3 personal
                        discard
                        slots).</p>

                    <h3>Victory</h3>
                    <p>Victory is accomplished by playing Equipment Cards on
                        your Quartermaster to be prepared for use by your Knight
                        and Peasant. Once prepared, an Equipment card can then
                        be equipped to either your Knight or your Peasant,
                        during your Play Phase. Use your Peasants to attack a
                        rival kingdom. Use your Knight to defend your King. Once
                        a King has depleted his 20 health points, he is no
                        longer in play. Be the last King standing and you are
                        victorious!</p>

                        <h3>Forge</h3>
                        <p>The Forge is your primary source for stocking your
                            hand each turn. The Forge deck is 1 of the 3 places
                            you can draw from during the Draw Phase of your
                            turn.</p>

                        <h3>Graveyard</h3>
                        <p>The Graveyard is a community shared discard pile. The
                            Graveyard serves a dual purpose. It is also 1 of 3
                            places you can choose to draw from during the Draw
                            Phase of your turn. The Graveyard is always stacked
                            face up, and only the top card is accessible at any
                            time.</p>
                        <p><strong>Be careful! Anything you discard to the
                                Graveyard is then retrievable during the Draw
                                Phase of a rival kingdom's turn!</strong></p>

                        <h3>Salvage Yard</h3>
                        <p>There are 3 spots in your area of the play field
                            labeled "Salvage". These are additional discard
                            slots which can hold 1 card each. These cards can be
                            retrieved just like drawing from the Forge or the
                            Graveyard. However, your Salvage Cards are only
                            accessible to you.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Only 1 card per Salvage
                                spot. 3 total salvage cards per player at any
                                time.</em></p>

                        <h3>Quartermaster Slot</h3>
                        <p>The preparer and provider of weapons and armor for
                            your Knight and Peasant. One card may be played here
                            at a time. An Equipment card played here enters
                            preparation. The only time an Equipment card will
                            not need to be prepared by your Quartermaster is
                            when you play an Ace Card. An Ace can Resurrect the
                            top card of the Graveyard directly onto the Knight
                            or Peasant. Depending on the value of the Equipment
                            Card, the preparation cost varies. The cost of
                            preparation is paid in turns.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The only way to remove an
                                Equipment Card in process is to either wait
                                until it's done being prepared or discard it
                                directly to the Graveyard on your Discard
                                Phase.</em></p>

                            add that card's value in defense to your Knight. Use
                            the Knight to defend your King.</p>

                                replaced is then placed on the top of the
                                Graveyard. This <strong>does not</strong> count

                            together. Playing the 2 cards together is known as
                            <strong>recruiting.</strong> A recruited card can be
                            played as a card of your suit. Any card may become a
                            recruited card when paired with another card of its
                            same type regardless of suit. However, a Jack (wild
                            card) may only be used for Recruiting Equipment
                            (number-valued cards). A Jack cannot be used in
                            Recruiting a Queen or Ace.</p>
