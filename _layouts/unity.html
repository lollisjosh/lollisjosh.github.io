  <h4>Notes:</h4>
  <p>This is a prototype. My goal with this prototype was to create a few new mechanics for a flappy-like. The stance
    position on the board affects the surfer's lift-behavior. In development mode (Unity Editor), designers can hotswap
    enemy flight patterns at the drop of a pattern object. This game prototype utilizes concepts like dependency
    injection, custom events/triggers, color lerping, etc. This build does not factor in collisions between obstacles
    and the player. The main showcase of this build is the surfer control mechanics, and the enemy movement dependency
    injection
    aspect. The art and music is by myself. The music uses samples form other sources, but is soley used here for
    education purposes. Nothing from this project, or on this website is for sale, ever.
